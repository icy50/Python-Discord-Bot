# Tutorial and Steps
## Step 1
Go to the Microsoft Store and search for Python 3.10 or higher.
Also install a code editor like Visual Studio or any other ones (don't
use online editors because the code won't work)

## Step 2
Now download the bot.py file and double-click it to open it on your code editor.
After that replace the YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your bot's token, don't share it.

## Step 2 (optional)
You can change up any commands or anything in the code if you want.

## Step 3
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/(bot_id)/oauth2
and click on the bot scope and click on the Adminstrator permission.
Copy the link that's generated, paste it in the browser and authorize your bot to your server.

## Step 4
Run the bot.py and there will be these stuff and code in the output area:
**
[ some random code are gonna be here 
for some random reasons when the code runs ]

Logged in as (your bot's name)
Synced (number of commands) commands

## Step 5
You should have the commands in your server by typing **/** (command name)

## Note
You must run the code while using the command plus you must put in your bot token
in the BOT_TOKEN_HERE placeholder in the code before running.
